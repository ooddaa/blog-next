<TLDR>
I want to streamline my blogging. 
Because if I don't there won't be any üìù

End goal:

‚úçÔ∏è Write this as a Markdown file on GitHub

‚úÖ Click commit

‚ú® Have it magically apear online, looking all nice and pretty. 

ü§´ way nicer and prettier than a simple Markdown would allow though
</TLDR>

## Blablabla
Same with playing the guitar - I want to actually learn to play it. But if every time I have an urge
to practice Lateralus, I have to invest more than 15seconds to set things up - well, chances are it ain't gonna happen.
<PB8/>

Instead, I just made it simple - guitar is next to the amp, cabels are plugged. Take the guitar out, push the button and play.
And I got so much more mileage from this setup over the years. 
I am lazy but I am stubborn, what can I say.
<PB8/>

## My problem
**a)** Blogging is not easy. For me it isn't. 
So I want to make the production as simple as possible and focus on the content. Ideally, any time I have something going on which I'd like to put in writing to understand better,
I need some quick and easy way to write and publish it. 
<PB4/>
**b)** My second problem is that I'm not using Medium or any other free publicly available bloggin platform. Because that's not the point. The point is to learn how things work and progress. 
By exposing myself to all the problems that come with creating my blog/website from scratch, I made more progress than I think I would have if I started my blog on Medium. 
<PB8/>
## Time to simplify and automate
So at first my workflow looked like this: 
**a)** Create posts.tsx file that exports an array of Posts, each Post being
<PB4/>
```typescript
 type Post = {
  id: number,
  slug: string,
  header: string,
  subheader: string,
  dateCreated: [number, number, number],
  author: string,
  timeToRead: string,
  timeToThink: string,
  ersion: string,
  tags: string[],
  body: React.Node
}
``` 
<PB8/>
**b)** Then any time I wanted to write a new blogpost, I'd copy this skeleton, *write the content as a jsx body* and add the result to the exported array.
<PB4/>
```typescript
 [
  ...posts,
  {
  id: 1,
  slug: "slug",
  header: "header",
  subheader: "subheader",
  dateCreated: [2022, 2, 10],
  author: "author",
  timeToRead: "timeToRead",
  timeToThink: "timeToThink",
  ersion: "0.0.1",
  tags: [],
  body:  <div> hey, let's spend too much time setting things up? </div>
}
```
<PB4/>
**c)** Then I would not want to do it ever again. 
<PB4/>

### write the content as a jsx body
It is this part that made me cringe and find excuses not to write the next blogpost every time I had an inclination to do so. 
<PB8/>

## My Solution
So I decided to invest a bit of time and do the setup properly. I will write Markdown + custom .tsx elements in .mdx files, store them locally (for now) and have GitHub deploy to Heroku every time I push into main branch. 
<PB4/>
Let's see how this works.
<PB8/>

### Markdown
First, I did not want to write any more .jsx/.tsx/html, I wanted to write simple human readable text, with as little decorations as possible. Hence <WebLink href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</WebLink>. It is never a bad idea to level up your Markdown skills, is it. 
<PB8/>

### .mdx files
Can I write Markdown files, store them locally and transform them into a usable <Code>.tsx</Code>? Yep, sure, rtfm on <WebLink href="https://mdxjs.com/docs/">MDX</WebLink>
<PB4/>
And since I am eye hall deep in Next.js, this <WebLink html="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx">rtfm</WebLink> is also of importance.
