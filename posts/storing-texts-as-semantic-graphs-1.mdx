<TLDR>
A hobby project: to build a system that learns through conversation.
I am playing with <WebLink href="https://discord.js.org/">Discord.js</WebLink> to build Discord bot, <WebLink href="https://spacy.io/">Spacy.io</WebLink> for NLP and <WebLink href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</WebLink> to build Knowledge Graphs. 
<br/>
In the process I am reading two great books:

a) <WebLink href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-word-grammar/1E5A02DD80F349284AA43599D825E93C">Word Grammar</WebLink> by Richard Hudson


b) <WebLink href="https://www.manning.com/books/graph-powered-machine-learning">Graph-Powered Machine Learning</WebLink> by Alessandro Negro
</TLDR>

## 1. Understanding the problem
### What's the unknown?
How to store a text so that we can extract and generalise useful knowledge from it?
<PB4/>

### What's the data?
English texts of various lengths/topics etc. They are produced by real people and have the following lingustic structure: 
<PB8/>
<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
<Image src="/blog/granola/levels_of_linguistic_structure.png" width={300} height={300} />
</div>
<PB8/>

### What's the condition?
The data architecture must make explicit: 
<PB4/>
<Code block>
a) the temporal structure of the text;
b) the syntactic structure of the text; 
c) significant (meaningful) entities. 
d) relationships (aka meaning) among entities.
</Code>
<PB8/>

## 2. Planning 
The best way to expose relationships in a dataset is to build a graph out of them. This way we will be able to *a)* visualise the various structures that we want to expose and *b)* build the underlying data structures that we can traverse for our further analyses. 
<PB4/>
We will use Neo4j and write Cypher queries to test a simple example of a 4 sentence text stored as a graph.
<PB8/>

## 3. Execution

### Where do we start?
Let's start by exposing a simple temporal structure of the text. 
<PB4/>
Any text written from left-right, or in any other consistent fasion is conveying its linear temporal structure (sentence has a beginning and end and proceeds from the beginning to the end).
<PB4/>
We will deal with purple "Morphology" level (ie words) first. This will give us the temporal structure.
<PB8/>

### What can we do?
We can make this linear structure explicit by storing text as a sequence of meaningful units (for us these are words and punctuation marks) using <Code>(Unit)-[:NEXT]->(Unit)</Code> graph. 
<PB4/>
Here is an example of a 4 sentence text stored as a graph that exposes its temporal structure.
This graph shows that the text (blue node) has 4 sentences (pink nodes), each sentence has words (red nodes). Words are connected by temporal relationships.  
<PB4/>

<PB8/>
### What do we gain by doing it?
By making temporal relationships explicit we will be able to:
<PB4/>
<Code block>
a) check correctness of grammar 
b) extract patterns
c) improve information search
d) ...???
</Code>
<PB8/>

## 4. Revision
We managed to store a text as a sequence of sentences each containing a sequence of words and punctuation marks. We stored it as a graph that has <Code>(Unit)-[:NEXT]->(Unit)</Code> structure. 
<PB4/>
We can use this basic skeleton as the foundation and extend the data architecture to support more advanced features: syntactic analysis and semantic analysis.
