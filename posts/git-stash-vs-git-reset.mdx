<TLDR>
  Yesterday, after ditching a bunch of useful code because I thought it
  contained a bug which it did not, I made a rule to:
  <div className="flex w-full justify-center gap-2 pt-4">
    <Code>git stash</Code> <Span color="red"> instead of </Span>
    <Code>git reset --hard</Code>
  </div>
</TLDR>

## Of course it depends
        
on what kind of garbage code you are throwing away. If you are 100%
sure it should perish, then <Code>git reset --hard</Code> and never
look back. But what if you're wrong and you've just binned a code that
might worth at least 50kcal ??

### Let me share my example.
Yesterday I helped my wife deploy her React project to
<a
  className="hover:text-amber-800 underline decoration-solid"
  href="https://www.netlify.com"
>Netlify</a> 
The build was failing because by default Netlify's build
configuration was set to treat React's warnings as errors. Two plans
were obvious, I should either:
<PB4/>
        
<Code>1. Correct the codebase - get rid of warnings</Code>
<br/>
<Code>2. Correct Netlify's config - make it ignore warnings.</Code>
<PB8/>

### Dealing with warnings

As I wrote in my recent
<WebLink href="/blog/setting-document-event-listeners-with-React-useEffect-hook">Setting document event listeners with React useEffect hook</WebLink> post, I used a <Code>useEffect</Code> hooks to set up document
listeners and React's linter warned me:
<PB4/>
  <Image
    className="rounded mx-auto"
    width={800}
    height={800}
    src="/missingDependency.png"
    alt=""
  />

<PB8/>
        
Naturally, I did not pay any attention to the warning, because it's just a warning; and

<Blockquote cite="Donald Knuth">
  Premature optimization is the root of all evil
</Blockquote>
        
That is until the moment when Netlify deployment was derailed off of
these unhandled warnings.
<PB8/>

### Long story short

I managed to wrap everything in <Code>useCallback</Code> hooks or move
function definitions inside useEffect hook so that its dependencies do
not change on each render. As per the suggestion:
<PB4/>

<Image
    className="rounded mx-auto"
    width={800}
    height={800}
    src="/wrapInuseCallback.png"
    alt=""
  />
<PB4/>

It was a bit of struggle. But then I was all set - no warnings from
compiler. Yas!
<PB8/>
        
The only problem was that in a previous commit I added a dependency to
<PB4/>

```javascript 
/* init state */
  useEffect(() => {
    reset();
  }, []);
```
<PB4/>
Which became:
<PB4/>
```javascript 
/* init state */
  useEffect(() => {
    reset();
  }, [reset]);
```
<PB4/>
          
Again, as per Create-react-app's suggestion:
<PB4/>
<Image
  className="rounded mx-auto"
  width={800}
  height={800}
  src="/addResetAsDependency.png"
  alt=""
/>
<PB8/> 

### Things go wrong
Which went horribly wrong - the app just kept re-setting its state,
because that's what <Code>reset()</Code> is for. But nevermind.
Important thing here is that I missed the fact that I broke the app
following compiler's advice and commited a bug. Then, after I wrangled
all warnings and was ready to show Netlify who's the boss, I quickly
peeked at whether the app was actually doing what it supposed to do.
Which it wasn't.
<PB8/>

My quick panic reaction was that it must have been the current latest
changes (a lot of wrangling with moving code/adding
dependencies/wrapping in useCallbacks) that introduced the error. So I
decided to discard all convoluted code wrangling and hit
<Code>git reset --hard</Code>...
<PB8/>

... only to discover that nope, that code was not the reason the bug
existed. And yes, after 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#Documentation/git-reset.txt---hard">doing hard rest</a>
I cannot get it back.
<PB8/>

What I should have done was to simply
<PB4/>
```zsh
$ git stash save wrangleDeps
```
<PB4/>

which would've discarded all the changes in the current working tree
anyways, **AND** I'd have access to the work I had done.
Which turned out to be useful and not related to the bug that I
caught. The sad part - now I need to do the wrangling again. But this
time I'll <Code>git stash</Code> <Span color="red">instead of </Span><Code>git reset</Code>
<PB8/>

### to be continued ...
My plan now is to correct the <Code>reset</Code> as a dependency
mistake and then follow Option 2 - make Netlify ignore my warnings.
