<TLDR>
  First thing that I discovered after starting this blog is that it is
  not exactly easy to present a code snippet so that it doesn't look
  ugly af. And I consider myself an **anti-ugly-af-guy** most of the
  time.
<PB4/>
Hence I found a beautiful React Component Library created by amazing <WebLink href="https://github.com/rtivital">Vitaly Rtishchev</WebLink> called
<WebLink href="https://mantine.dev">Mantine!</WebLink>

</TLDR>
        
## Bliss
  Before Mantine Prism I had to figure out how to highlight my code snippets. It turned out to be quite a pain. 
<PB4/>
To get something like this:

<pre>
  <code>
      <span style={{ color: "green" }}>
      </span>
      <br />
      <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>const</span> a = 1;
      <br />
      <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>function</span>{" "}<span style={{ color: "orange" }}>fun</span>() {`{`}
      <span style={{ color: "blue" }}> let</span> smth = 0;
      <span style={{ color: "purple" }}> return</span> smth;
      {`}`}
  </code>
</pre>
<PB4/>

Which underhood looks pretty ugly and laboursome: 
<pre>
  <code>
  {`<pre>
  <code>
      <span style={{ color: "green" }}>
      </span>
      <br />
      <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>
        const </span> a = 1;
      <br />
      <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>
        function
      </span>{" "}
      <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>
        fun</span>() 
      <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>
       let</span> smth = 0;
      <span style={{ color: "purple" }}> 
      return</span> smth;
  </code>
</pre>`}
</code>
</pre>

## Reinvent the wheel?
As a driven (and not always for the good reasons) engineer, my first 
reaction to this was to quickly slap together a tool to turn my ugly code 
snippets into my beautiful swan code snippets.

*Thank god I did't do it!*
<PB4/>
Becase now I can just use a <Code>{"<Prism />"}</Code> component from
  <WebLink href="https://mantine.dev/others/prism/">Mantine Prism</WebLink> to
  effortlessly make JS/TS code look good. Voil√†:  
<PB4/>
<Prism language="tsx">{`const a = 1;
  function fun(): number {
   let smth = 0;
   return smth;
  }`}</Prism>
<PB4/>
Or use <Code>colorScheme="dark"</Code> to make it dark like
<WebLink href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/">Rober Eggers's</WebLink> movies:
<PB8/>

<JS colorScheme="dark">
  {`const a = 1;
  function fun(): number {
   let smth = 0;
   return smth;
  }`}
</JS>
<PB8/>

### Isn't it lovely? üí•

*PS* I'm still figuring out how to highlight Elixir code. But that's for another post.
*2023-09-26 update* I've migrated <WebLink href="https://mantine.dev/guides/6x-to-7x/">from Mantine 6 to Mantine 7</WebLink> which means that I will no longer be using Prism. Not to mention the fact that I've been using <WebLink href="https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/">Rehype Pretty Code</WebLink> which plays well with Next.js. 
<PB4/>
Nevertheless, Prism will have a special place in my heart, you were my first...
