<TLDR>
I want to streamline my blogging. If I don't there won't be any blogging ;))
</TLDR>

## Barrier to entry
Same with playing the guitar - want to actually learn to play it? Be consistent, help yourself: 
put it next to the amp, cabels, pedals - all next to each other.
<PB4/>
This way you'll will pick it up an play without wasting energy on setup. I'm sure there's a technical
term to describe the "activation energy" that brain has to spend to engage in an activity, I don't remember. 
So the point it not to waste it on the setup, set things up upfront. 

## Practice deliberately 
Blogging is not easy. For me. But the more I do it, less energy I spend on it. Deliberate practicing.
