<TLDR>
If you practice everyone's favourite ***code first - think later*** approach, then these are your best friends:
<PB4/>
- <Code>git stash </Code>
- <Code>git stash list </Code>
- <Code>git stash pop </Code>
</TLDR>

## My workflow

Sometimes I struggle with keeping my coding organised. My projects are
fair game for me - I can touch any part of it whenever I want. Which
produces convoluted coding sessions.
<PB8 />

Which more often than not creates a lot of unnecessary code
re-writing. Or, even more often, after I wrote something, I realise
that it logically belongs to another branch.
<PB8 />

If there is <span className="text-lg font-bold">NO</span> other
branch, I simply
<PB4/>

```
$ git checkout -b newBranch
$ git commit -am "stuff that should be on newBranch
```

<PB8 />
If there <span className="text-lg font-bold">IS</span> the other
branch that logically owns the changes, no biggie,
<Code>git stash</Code> to the rescue!
<PB4/>

```
$ git stash       // all changes on current branch are 
                  // reverted, equals to git reset --hard
$ git checkout anotherBranch
$ git stash list  // shows us the stack of stash@{number}: 
                  // WIP on <branchName>: <branchHash> <branchComment>
$ git stash pop   // there might be some conflicts for manual resolution, 
                  // I accept all incoming (stashed) changes
$ git commit -am "stuff that should have been on anotherBranch
```
<PB8/>

## Voila!

We now have appropriately positioned and accounted for our code. ðŸ¥³
