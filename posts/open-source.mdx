<TLDR>
Moving from hoarding behavior to embracing open source (in my case, transitioning from private Bitbucket to public GitHub) requires a significant shift in mindset. It all comes down to pondering Aristotle's famous quote:

<Blockquote className="pb--3rem" cite="- Aristotel">
  Do I aspire to become a better developer, coder, programmer, or professional?
</Blockquote>

- If the answer is **YES**, then choose the public path.
- If the answer is **NO**, then why are you reading this at all?
</TLDR>

### Public vs Private
Since embarking on my coding journey in 2012, I've held a firm belief that the code I create carries significance. Although I couldn't always articulate precisely why or how it mattered, and despite my inexplicable confidence that others would invest their valuable time in reviewing, adopting, or adapting my code, I now recognize that I was somewhat delusional. At that time, I lacked experience and was apprehensive about potential criticism from my peers.
<PB8/>

However, as I've begun sharing my work in public spaces, my perspective has shifted, revealing that working openly in this manner not only enhances my skills as a software engineer but also contributes to personal growth as a human being. Consequently, I've distilled these three guiding principles I now uphold:
<PB8/>

### 1. Prioritizing public commits over hoarding code is my philosophy.
Pushing changes to the main branch compels me to tackle problems with a sense of urgency (those satisfying green commits are my motivation). However, I'm acutely aware that I don't want to contribute subpar work. This creates a constant struggle with what I call "Unrelenting Standards" ‚Äì the belief that it's better to strive for perfection and never share it than to share something imperfect now.
<PB4/>
Choosing the latter option was a challenging decision, especially for someone with perfectionist tendencies like me. I consciously acknowledged my inclination to fixate on minute and inconsequential details, giving them undue importance. This reluctance to share work that I deemed "imperfect" used to weigh heavily on me. However, I've overcome that hurdle, and now, it feels liberating rather than anxiety-inducing.
<PB8/>

### 2. Prioritizing documentation over code is essential.

Prioritizing documentation over code is crucial to me. I aspire to take pride in my work, and the most reliable path to achieve this is through gradual improvement. Since "incrementally" implies taking small steps over time, every time I come back to my old code this question pops up:
<Blockquote className="" cite="- everyone">
**Why is this here, anyway?**
</Blockquote>
<PB4/>

It often consumes a significant amount of my time just to recall the purpose of a piece of code, or whether it's essential or expendable. Thus, I discipline myself to invest time in adding code comments, documentation, and notes. 
<PB8/>
To be entirely candid, the benefits of thoroughly considering the purpose behind my code far outweigh the fleeting gains of hastily writing code, only to later revise it five times and delete it twice.
<PB8/>
              
### 3. Choosing competition over self-delusion is wiser.

This is a significant point for me. Open source fosters competition among ideas, even if it's mainly a mental battle. Let's be honest, not many people will thoroughly review my repositories. However, if someone does, I'd be genuinely excited to hear their feedback (after taking a few deep breaths, of course).
<PB8/>

Stashing code away in my drawer stifles its potential to become something useful for real users. Sharing it with the public, even if it's just a small chance, opens up possibilities. Of course, there's plenty of work to do after a simple <Code>git push</Code> but without that initial step, there won't be any progress. 
<PB8/>

### Conclusion
Choosing to keep my code in a public repo üçâ vs hoarding all of it in a private repo gives me motivation to develop
as a professional.
