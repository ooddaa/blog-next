<TLDR>
Setting up a REST API on Heroku to retreive Yahoo! Finance stock prices as close as possible to daily option trades is easier if you write some documentation.
Well, any software maintenance is easier with documentation. DOCUMENTATION!
</TLDR>

##  What do you do when your wife trades US stock options?
        
You try to stay out of it as much as possble üòÇ. But how can I say no when my dear wife, K, asks me to help her add US stocks prices to her option trading log, which she runs on Google Sheets?
<PB8/>

### So

K, after a hard trading day, copy-pastes her option combos, strangles
and whatnot data to Sheets from Interactive Brokers' TWS.
Unfortunately, IB's option trade reports do not come with a precise
price of the underlying at the moment of option trade's execution.
<PB8/>

Let's say she has this record:
<PB4/>

```
AMD [STOCK PRICE ???] 19/11/2020 11:43:35 
BTO LONG CALL +3 
AMD NOV27'20 93 CALL 0.57 3.59
```
<PB8/>

It would be handy to know how much AMD traded for at 11:43:35 on November 19, 2020, right? 
Ok, maybe we aren't that fastidious and can round time down to 11:43.
<PB8/>
  
If so, then the easiest way to get stock prices is to use YahooPrices
API. ...of which no documentation in human-readable format exists...
<PB8/>

Ran Aroussi published a nice Python package - <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/">yfinance</a>. Many thanks, Ran! We are going to use this package to set up our simple Yahoo! Prices REST API on Heroku.
<PB8/>

### The plan:
-  <Code>1. Launch a Python Yahoo Prices API on Heroku,</Code>
-  <Code>2. Call it from Google Sheets and</Code>
-  <Code>3. Update K's trading logs with underlying prices.</Code>
<PB4/>

### Step 1. Set up the Prices API
The API is now accessible on <a href="https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>. To use it - simply POST with an application/json body set as follows:
<PB4/>

```
{ 
  "data": Ticker[] 
}
```
<PB2/>

Where each Ticker is:
<PB4/>

```
[
  ticker: str, 
  # price may be skipped 
  # for POST request, add 
  # null in Postman 
  # at the moment of writing 
  # this post, it's hard to 
  # remember why I split 
  # time into two lists like this.         
  [
    year:int, 
    month:int, 
    day:int
  ], 
  [
    hour:int, 
    min:int, 
    sec:int
  ]
]
```    
<PB8/>
If it all goes right, Yahoo Prices API will add a
<PB4/>
        
```
price: float
```
<PB4/>
to each Ticker.
<PB8/>

## To the future!

As I am writing this, a month has passed since I launched the stuff
above, and I hardly can remember how things were arranged!
        
I am sending a POST request with Postman to <a href="https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a> with a properJSON:
<PB4/> 

```json
{ 
  "data": [
    ["AMD", null, [2022, 3, 10], [15, 0, 0]]
  ]
}
```
<PB4/>

But get a
<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/500-internal-server-error-explained-2622938">500 Internal Server Error</a>
response, which is üò¨
<PB4/>

Let's investigate, shall we üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<PB4/>
          
```
$ heroku logs -app=yahooprices --tail
```
<PB4/>

Lo and behold, we&quot;ve got ourselves a bug!
<PB4/>

ü§î ???
<PB4/>
        
Ah yes, it all comes back to me now - the last feature that I added
was to allow for all prices from the query to be returned as part of
the response. Then users could sort themselves out should the main
timestamp not be available. I did it by adding a new route:
<PB4/>
```
POST 
https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com/allPrices
```
<PB4/>

But in so doing, I forgot to set a default value to the new argument
<PB4/>
        
```
attach_prices=False
```
<PB4/>
        
of the underlying function that handles data requests for both routes.
I should have done like this:
<PB4/>
        
```
# yahoo.py 
def get_prices(
      tickers, 
      attach_prices=False):
   ...
```
<PB4/>

Now, when users call the old route:
<PB4/>
        
```
POST https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com/
```
<PB4/>

they get
<PB4/>

```json
{
  "data": [
    [
      "AMD",
      105.810302734375,
      [
        2022,
        3,
        10
      ],
      [
        15,
        0,
        0
      ]
    ]
  ]
}
```
<PB8/>

### I'll have a takeaway, please üçü 
<Code>Write more WHY-comments in your code.</Code>
<Code>Set sensible defaults.</Code>
<Code>Test all the time.</Code>
