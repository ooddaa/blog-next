<TLDR>
  After not touching my old blog, scaffolded with <Code>create-react-app</Code>, for a long while, I decided it was time to jazz it up a bit. By <Code>a bit</Code> I mean <Code>let's not rewrite it again from scratch in Elixir</Code> (I'll do it another time). So <WebLink href="https://nextjs.org/" alt="link to Next.js website">Next.js 13</WebLink>, here we go!    
  <PB4 />
  I was pleasantly surprised with Next.js 13, especially its new <WebLink href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-router" alt="link to App router docs">App Router</WebLink> and, overall, the quality of the documentation.  
  
  It took me no more than 5 minutes to solve the hiccups that I ran into - all thanks to the sane documentation. Well, typical Typescript's moaning aside that is. 
  <PB4 />
  In fact, it feels like I deleted more code than I wrote and everything still works fine üòÇ
</TLDR>

## Part 1
As I sat down to rewrite my blog, I found myself facing a familiar challenge in the JS/TS landscape. After a year spent in the realm of Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView, I braced myself for the return to the world of JavaScript. However, armed with determination and a newfound excitement, I embarked on the journey of transforming my blog from a Create-React-App to a Next.js 13 application. Little did I know that this transition would not only reignite my interest in TypeScript but also showcase the brilliance of Next.js.

## Freshen up the environment
The first step was to ensure I had the right tools for the task at hand. I swiftly installed the latest version of Node.js (20.5.1) using the heavenly <WebLink href="https://asdf-vm.com/" alt="link to asdf">asdf</WebLink>. 
<PB4/>

```
// install asdf plugin for Node.js and 
$ asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git

// list what's available to be installed 
$ asdf list-all nodejs

// pick a version and install it
$ asdf install nodejs 20.5.1

// to see which versions are installed on your machine 
$ ls ~/.asdf/installs/nodejs/
```
<PB4/>

Ok, why not treat ourselves while we're at it? I mean install <WebLink href="https://bun.sh/" alt="link to Bun website">Bun</WebLink> to speed up local development.
<PB4/>
```
// install asdf plugin for Bun and 
$ asdf plugin add bun

// list what's available to be installed 
$ asdf list-all bun

// pick a version and install it
$ asdf install bun 0.7.3

// to see which versions are installed on your machine 
$ ls ~/.asdf/installs/bun/
```
<PB4/>
Now to run my blog with <Code>Node.js 20.5.1</Code> or <Code>Bun 0.7.3</Code> all I have to do is:
<PB4/>
```
// create a .tool-versions file in the 
// project root folder with the nodejs version
$ echo "nodejs 20.5.1" > .tool-versions
$ echo "bun 0.7.3" >> .tool-versions
```
<PB4/>

With this, I was ready to dive into the world of Next.js. Gone were the days of struggling with the Node.js module system; this time, I was determined to conquer it.

### Documentation
My experience with Elixir had taught me the value of well-written documentation, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Next.js shared the same sentiment. Navigating the the Next.js API documentation and the changelogs became a breeze, reminiscent of my days with Elixir.

### ECMAScript 2023
Next on the agenda was catching up with the latest developments in the JavaScript world. A quick glance at the new features in ECMAScript 2023 (ES14) revealed some welcome <WebLink href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3703571/all-the-new-features-in-ecmascript-2023-es14.html" alt="link to article">additions</WebLink>, including the handy <Code>Array.toReversed</Code> and <Code>Array.toSorted</Code> methods which create new arrays so, at least here, you can forget about mutability. Wow, has JS been moving in the direction of functional programming lately? I hope so.

### Create Next App
With a clear vision in mind, I embarked on the process of transforming my blog. The journey began with a simple command: 
<PB4/>
```
// create the project, agree to all defaults
$ npm create-next-app@latest
```
<PB4/>
The default setup was seamless, providing me with a solid foundation to build upon. Delving into the Next.js documentation, I navigated the intricacies of the App Router, folder structure, and other key components.

### Freshen up the landing page
As I copied over my Welcome page and toolbox utility from the old project to the new, TypeScript types became a priority. Thankfully, TypeScript's compatibility with Next.js allowed me to fix types with ease. Additionally, I streamlined the Welcome page's structure, opting for a simpler and more visually appealing design with a touch of green.
<PB4/>
In addition, I put in some background noise to make green portion look more textured and interesting. The noise was generated in Figma with awesome <WebLink href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1138854718618193875/Noise-%26-Texture" alt="link to Noise and Texture Figma plugin">Noise & Texture plugin</WebLink>.

### Deploy to Heroku
With my welcome page and blog content finally ready, it was time to deploy my creation to the cloud. Heroku was the chosen platform for this task. Why not Versel, I hear you ask. Well, prosaically, my old blog was running on Heroku, so &quot;the shortest road is the one you know&quot;. Following a straightforward process, I created a new app named &quot;oda-blog-next&quot; and linked it to my repository. A simple git push heroku main later, my Next.js blog was live.
<PB4/>
```
// create a new project
$ heroku create oda-blog-next

// link to repo
$ heroku git:remote -a oda-blog-next

// go online
$ git push heroku main
```
<PB4/>
As the final touch, I pointed my custom domain, www.ooddaa.co, to the new blog app. For that to happen I removed the custom domain from the old blog app, added it to the new one, updated DNS records at GoDaddy, and secured it with an SSL certificate auto-managed by Heroku.

### Not so fast, TypeScript here

Of course, a transition of this magnitude wasn't without its challenges. When I said <Code>was live</Code>, well, it wasn't until I wrestled all the errors that TS threw at me. Admittedly some of the problems were dealt with in a drastic way, <Code>just delete this crap cmon</Code>, some required learning from the <WebLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMfGp29Ht8c&list=PLIvujZeVDLMx040-j1W4WFs1BxuTGdI_b" alt="link to Matt Pocock youtube playlist">masters themselves</WebLink>. Felt good though, once the project compiled. It does, doesn't it üòÅ

### Kudos where kudos due
In conclusion, my venture from Create-React-App to Next.js 13 turned out to be not painfull at all, rather surprisingly I say. I would attribute it to the quality documentation and, well, 13th edition of software done by people way smarter than me, kudos to them!
