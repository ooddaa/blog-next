<TLDR>
If you practice everyone's favourite ***code first - think later*** approach, then these are your best friends:
<PB4/>
- <Code>git stash </Code>
- <Code>git stash list </Code>
- <Code>git stash pop </Code>
</TLDR>

## My workflow

Sometimes I struggle with keeping my coding organised. My projects are
fair game for me - I can touch any part of it whenever I want. Which
produces convoluted coding sessions.
<PB8 />

Which more often than not creates a lot of unnecessary code
re-writing. Or, even more often, after I wrote something, I realise
that it logically belongs to another branch.
<PB8 />

If there is <span className="text-lg font-bold">NO</span> other
branch, I simply
<PB4/>

```zsh
$ git checkout -b newBranch
$ git commit -am "to newBranch"
```

<PB8 />
If there <span className="text-lg font-bold">IS</span> the other
branch that logically owns the changes, no biggie,
<Code>git stash</Code> to the rescue!
<PB4/>

```zsh
// all changes on current branch are 
// reverted, equals to git reset --hard
$ git stash       
                  
$ git checkout anotherBranch

// shows us the stack of stash@{number} 
$ git stash list  

// there might be some conflicts 
// for manual resolution,  
// I accept all incoming changes
$ git stash pop    
                 
$ git commit -am "to anotherBranch"
```
<PB8/>

## Voila!

We now have appropriately positioned and accounted for our code. ðŸ¥³
