<TLDR>
In engineering an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) that holds identity data the key challenge from the start was how to ascertain the uniquness of data.
</TLDR>

## Single Source of Truth
How to make sure that the data supplied to the EKG could be accessed as a Single Source of Truth (<Bold>SST</Bold>) for its users?
<PB8/>

The key architectual decision was made to design a platform which
would help ensure that there are no copies of the same Node. A Node
would constitue whatever user deemed a <Bold>mental entity </Bold> to
which they already attached a &quot;uniquness&quot; attribute in their minds.
<PB8/>

## For example
Suppose there is a CEO, <SpongeBob/>, in our organization. All
employees have the same &quot;unique&quot; <SpongeBob/> in mind when they talk
about him in the pub after work. But when it comes to representing{" "}
<SpongeBob/> outside of employee&apos;s collective mind, say, writing an
email with some details/attributes of <SpongeBob/>, then each employee
might refer to their &quot;copy&quot; of these attributes, located wherever (on
their desktops/in their emails/in folders on Sharepoint/on pages of
Confluence etc).
<PB8/>

What&apos;s important here is that regardless of the quality and
consistency of this attribute data, there is not an equivalent digital
representation of <SpongeBob/> that can easily be referred to by all
employees should they need to &quot;speak&quot; of him digitally. There is
seldom an SST representation of <SpongeBob/> and as the result, a lot
of time is spent searching for the latest updated version of{" "}
<SpongeBob/>&apos;s attributes (long phone calls / emails to chase /
searching by text string and not by the meaning - <SpongeBob/>-ness).
<PB8/>

The essence, the &quot;CEO&quot;-ness is in fact transient -current CEO might
step down and another person can become a new CEO. In this case
everyone would make essential modifications to the notion of the
&quot;current CEO&quot;. But <SpongeBob/> won&apos;t go anywhere - it will persist in
the EKG as a new Chairsponge.
<PB8/>

## The Idea
The idea came up when I worked for a family office and was dealing
with bits and pieces of data coming across my desk. I noticed that I
would spend most of my time and effort not on the value-generating
activities relating to the data, but on solving questions like:
<PB8/>

<Code>What is the correct full address of Person X?</Code>
<Code>And at the point of time T?</Code>
<Code>Did we send that document to Y?</Code>
<Code>When?</Code>
<Code>What was in it?</Code>
<Code>Where can I find XYZ?</Code>

<PB8/>

It was obvious that the solutions to these questions (99% of time that
would be a source document, or colleague&apos;s advice) resided within my
colleague&apos;s minds or on their desktops/emails. We did have an old and
limited database that had some records of some legal entities and
natural persons - but to use that knowledge it had to be checked and
double-checked with colleagues first.
<PB8/>

Which in 50% of situations required them requesting the info from
their counterparties. The problem was that once all the effort was
made and the relevant info was received, verified and utilized, it was
simply forgotten until the next time when same problem arrived. And
when it did, usually after a prolonged period of time, no one could
easily locate the previous result to reduce the amount of cognitive
work.
<PB8/>

## Touch it if it&apos;s broken
A simple solution was to agree to share all such hard-earned
knowledge, but:
<PB8/>
<Bold>1.</Bold> Everyone wants to go on writing emails and making phone calls
(status quo bias).
<PB4/>
<Bold>2.</Bold> There was no simple way to do it. We tried Confluence - but it
required a learning curve that no one wanted (it at least did not
seem too exiting to do extra mental work for free).
<PB8/>

No one wants to archive. Archiving is a difficult mental work which is
not rewarded in an obvious, immediate way. Therefore no one does it at
will. This creates a huge (but familiar) tech debt in a form of
knowledge search, repeating same work that already has been done by
others.
<PB8/>

On the upside this is how office workers v1.0 justify the time they
spend in the office getting paid.
<PB8/>

## Future solution
Office workers v2.0 need to recognize, embrace and be rewarded for
Knowledge Sharing activities. They need to be confident in knowing
that there is a Single Source of Truth, accessible without <WebLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_impedance_mismatch">
  extra mental effort</WebLink>. And if there is extra mental effort required (to upload knowledge),
then it is rewarded immediately (reputation/points/perks etc) to
recognize Knowledge Sharing as a critical value-generating activity of
the 21 century.
